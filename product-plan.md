1. __Problem Statement__: There are times when people would like to eat out but do not want to eat alone. They might not be able to find anyone to eat with, or they simply do not want to ask others who probably might not want to eat out. There are also people who want to expand their network by eating with someone they have never met. The app would solve this problem of finding an eating companion at a restuarant of the user's choice.

1. __Market Research__: 
    - Competitors 
        - http://foodfriends.net/en/
            - It's a website, not a phone app, so it's hard to use for on-the-go users
        - meetup.com
            - It's not specifically built for people to find the eating companions, though people arrange the meetups to eat together.
    - Differentiation:
        - A mobile app that lets users use wherever they are
        - User-friendly
        - Tageted only Downtown Seattle
  
1. __User Personas__: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?
    - Adults aged between 25 - 40
    - Busy professionals who do not have time to expand their networks or meet up with friends outside of their working hours
