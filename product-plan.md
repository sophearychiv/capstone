# Capstone Product Plan

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__: 
    1. Java
    1. React Native
    1. Software Design
    1. MongoDB
    1. AWS

1. __Problem Statement__: There are times when people would like to eat out but do not want to eat alone. They might not be able to find anyone to eat with, or they simply do not want to ask others who probably might not want to eat out. There are also people who want to expand their network by eating with someone they have never met. The app would solve this problem of finding an eating companion at a restuarant of the user's choice.

1. __Market Research__: 
    - Competitors 
        - http://foodfriends.net/en/
    - research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
    - differentiation: what makes your idea/product different
  
1. __User Personas__: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?

1. __Trello Board__:
    - Flesh out the feature set that you created in the conceptual delivery to get started with your Trello board
  
1. __Technology selections__:
    - Front-end
    - Back-end
    - Infrastructure - Deployment or Code
  
1. __Wireframes__:
    - Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
